It's common knowledge that Efeeti can, and sometimes tend to rebel. What not all summoners know, is the fact that jinns can rebel too, but for a drastically different reason."

			message= _ "Such 'independent' jinns are often even granted citizenship by the Council of Elders. Like normal jinns, they usually tend to spend most their time in libraries; reading books, talking to other jinns, sharing their knowledge with people that are willing to listen, or argurguing about philosophical questions with their peers. Interestingly enough, more than half of our literature is actually written by jinns. Though cases of jinns abandoning their masters are very rare, and only happen due to serious neglect, it's still a good idea to give jinns some freedom, when their services aren't needed."

For example, Mystical Jinns are able to open dimensional vortexes. Besides allowing them to release abysmal energies on their foes during combat, this ability makes able to look into paralell dimensions through billlions of microscopic portals to see various possible future outcomes, and approximately predict the probability of each. It can get very confusing if you ask them to look too far in time, though, but this ability of theirs can prove extremely useful when you aren't sure what to do, or unaware of what are you going to encounter. Due to this, every city leader has at least one of them in his army."
