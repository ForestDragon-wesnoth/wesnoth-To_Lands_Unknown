#            message=_ "Although I only allowed you to ask you three questions, I'll make an exception. Tharis are a strange nation based on a mysterious cult. Their lands are very far away, so we are still in a process of gathering information about them. Nevertheless we have no reason to fear them yet. Their armies certainly are very powerful, but they are unable to reach the Sky Kingdom, since even their greatest mages can't fly upwards, only hover over the surface."
#            message=_ "Well, the Tharis are a strange nation with a cult of darkness as their religion. Their lands are very far away, and they've attempted to kill the scouts we sent to their land, so gathering information about them has proven to be a difficult task, to say the least. As for their threat, we have no reason to fear them as of now. Their armies certainly are very powerful, but they are unable to reach the Sky Kingdom, since, as you have seen, even your best carpet riders can't fly that high, not to mention the Tharis magi, who can only hover a few meters above the surface."
            message=_ "Afraid of them? Hardly, if at all. Their armies certainly are very powerful, but they are unable to reach the Sky Kingdom, since, as you have seen, even your best carpet riders can't fly that high, not to mention the Tharis magi, who can only hover a few meters above the surface. Anyway, as for the Tharis themselves, they're are a strange nation with a cult of darkness as their religion. Their lands are very far away, and they've attempted to kill the scouts we sent to their land, so gathering information about them has proven to be a difficult task, to say the least."
