Because they make for great test subjects. The ones you're granted are combat models; possessing extraordinary physical strength and advanced weaponry, but rather lacking in intellect, similarly to the Mus. Any Mu can be transformed into a such a powerful being, but the process is quite long and expensive, requiring lots and lots of magical augmentation, genetic modification, and nutrition. You wouldn't believe how many years of experimenting we spent to finally achieve this."
