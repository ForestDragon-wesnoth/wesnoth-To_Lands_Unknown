If you want to translate the campaign, follow these instructions:

1. Download Poedit (this is a free editor for translating apps)
https://poedit.net/download

2. Open TLU_raw_translation_file.po (usually located in add-ons/To_Lands_Unknown/translations/

3. Choose your language via settings

4. Start translating (the user interface is very easy to master)

5. When finished, export .mo file and share it on the forums in this topic:
http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=31799

so I can release it officially.

All translators will be mentioned in the add-on's credits.
