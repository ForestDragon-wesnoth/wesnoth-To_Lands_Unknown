-In order to simulate height, some (or even most, in some scenarios) hexes are either unwalkable or impassable (unwalkable meaning that only flying units can move there, impassable meaning that the hex is simply off limits. Just a reminder for new players)

The usage of magic, and thus the Abyss entirely reshaped our civilization. We use the abyssal energies for our needs on a daily basis, which is the very reason we're called Summoners."

Unrestrained by imagination, this entity is the most powerful being we know to this day. He was godlike, able to bend the laws of nature to at a whim, but preferring to observe things the way they are.

He understood our language, and turned out to be obedient, like all magical entities summoned afterwards. We still don't know why exactly he decided to obey us, but we're certainly glad he did."

Shortly thereafter, the towers al-Kamija risen from the sands.

A few centuries have passed since those days. Nomolas rests in the central palace, wanting not to interfere with our lives. We try to only awaken him if there really is no other choice. The power of magical entities summoned after Nomolas paled in comparison to him, but their power is still not to be underestimated, and is fully sufficient for our needs."

However, in the last few years, our great minds came up with a design for a special magic circle that should be able to take us to that unreal world. Our tests were an astounding success, but to this day we cannot summon previously sent items back to our world. As a result of this, though it may sound crazy, we decided the entirety of our land into the Abyss, hoping that we will find the solution on the other side. But even if we find it, we may not be able to use it...

It should be stressed that we believe we will find in the Abyss the ultimate sense of our life and intend to stay there forever."

In the next few months, the Great Circle would be ready and then their whole country would disappear from this world. At this stage, interfering in foreign wars was unthinkable, yet the Elders felt it indicated to show some concerned interest in the situation of the kinfolk. Thus, Mehir was to act as an envoy: he would deliver a letter from the council to the people of Kharos - an invitation to move together with the Summoners into the Abyss. Such a nice gesture seemed adequate, if not the only chance of survival for the people in the old native country. The High Council ordered three ships to be built specifically for Mehir's departure, similar in design to the one Atiros sailed in. Mehir himself was quite fine with the idea of officially representing the nation. And as much as he liked the lavish lifestyle of his palace, Rashti's perpetual nagging and hiss own worry of getting fat and lazy kind of spoiled the whole thing. A short trip to pleasantly cool lands would do him good, an amuse his protegee as well."

However, experiments carried out by the Summoners in former days had shown that fluctuations of time between the worlds had the delay of twenty-five days between events and their visible consequences. The messenger had traveled for twelve days, which meant the Summoners had thirteen days to finish the Circle in its original formula and move to the Abyss.
