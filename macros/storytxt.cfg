-The campaign is set in a different universe from the mainline Battle for Wesnoth one, they aren't meant to be related.
-In order to simulate height, some (or even most, in some scenarios) hexes are either unwalkable or impassable (unwalkable meaning that only flying units can move there, impassable meaning that the hex is simply off limits. Just a reminder for new players)
-halos, unit animations, etc. are used extremely often here. You'd miss a large part of TLU-unique experience with those disabled."#enddef

This unusual tropical land was a holy place for its dwellers, and for them, it must be protected at all costs.

Despite that, Rhaxiz hadn’t attacked because Mehir explained that he was not from the east, where enemy was living, but from the north. Nevertheless the appearance of a ‘fiery demon’ scared the lizards so much that they thrown themselves on the Summoners, thinking that they wanted to burn down their holy forest.

Even the finest magic carpets we unable to reach such altitude, so Mehir decided to draw a special one-way teleportation circle on the ship’s floor, with the materials he had. A two-way teleportation circle was impossible to make given the lack of access to the other side. After a few hours everything was ready and, to boost the troops' morale, Mehir decided to be the first to teleport to the ‘flying island’."
